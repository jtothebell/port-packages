# port-packages

This repo holds the packaging for ports that I either have PR'ed or hope to PR to https://github.com/christianhaitian/PortMaster for running on retro handheld devices.

As of now these are all FNA based commercial games that require the purchase of a game. They also all require a mono runtime, so if you are trying to get one working, you'll either need to manually place the mono runtime executable  in the portmaster directory or install another FNA based port first

Shipwreck has been tested with the itch.io linux and windows versions (https://brushfiregames.itch.io/shipwreck)

Fez has been tested with the humble DRM free linux version (https://www.humblebundle.com/store/fez)

Axiom verge has been tested with the epic games version (AFAIK the only DRM free version- https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/axiom-verge)
